Configuring phpmyadmin
----------------------

The phpmyadmin package must have a database installed and configured before it 
can be used.  This can be optionally handled with dbconfig-common.

If you are an advanced database administrator and know that you want to perform 
this configuration manually, or if your database has already been installed and 
configured, you should refuse this option.  Details on what needs to be done 
should most likely be provided in /usr/share/doc/phpmyadmin.

Otherwise, you should probably choose this option.

Please select the mail server configuration type that best meets your needs.

 No configuration:
  Should be chosen to leave the current configuration unchanged.
 Internet site:
  Mail is sent and received directly using SMTP.
 Internet with smarthost:
  Mail is received directly using SMTP or by running a utility such
  as fetchmail. Outgoing mail is sent using a smarthost.
 Satellite system:
  All mail is sent to another machine, called a 'smarthost', for delivery.
 Local only:
  The only delivered mail is the mail for local users. There is no network.

The "mail name" is the domain name used to "qualify" _ALL_ mail addresses 
without a domain name. This includes mail to and from <root>: please do not make
your machine send out mail from root@example.org unless root@example.org has 
told you to.

This name will also be used by other programs. It should be the single, fully

Thus, if a mail address on the local host is foo@example.org, the correct value 
for this option would be example.org.

Configuring postfixadmin
------------------------

The postfixadmin package must have a database installed and configured before it
can be used.  This can be optionally handled with dbconfig-common.

If you are an advanced database administrator and know that you want to perform 
this configuration manually, or if your database has already been installed and 
configured, you should refuse this option.  Details on what needs to be done 
should most likely be provided in /usr/share/doc/postfixadmin.

Otherwise, you should probably choose this option.

[4mConfigure database for postfixadmin with dbconfig-common? [24m[1my

The postfixadmin package can be configured to use one of several database types.
Below, you will be presented with the available choices.
